<h2>EXPERIMENTAL software</h2>
<p>This is EXPERIMENTAL beta software. It contains many remaining bugs!</p>

<h2>NOT working right now</h2>
<ul>
<li>Importing existing keys will be stripped of certificates right now</li>
<li>Key cross-certification is NOT supported, so signing with those keys will get a warning when the signature is checked.</li>
<li>K9 Mail integration not implemented</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to contribute, fork it and do a pull request on Github: <a href="https://github.com/dschuermann/openpgp-keychain">https://github.com/dschuermann/openpgp-keychain</a></p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>Install K-9 Mail for the best integration, it supports APG for PGP/INLINE and lets you directly encrypt/decrypt emails.
<br/>It is recommended that you install OI File Manager to be able to use the browse button for file selection in APG.
<br/>First you need some keys. Either import them via the option menus in "Manage Keys" and "My Keys" or create them in "My Keys".</p>

<h2>I found a bug in OpenPGP Keychain!</h2>
