<h2>Beta software</h2>
<p>This is beta software. It contains many remaining bugs!</p>

<h2>APG</h2>
<p>Android Privacy Guard (APG) is a OpenPGP implementation for Android.
<br />This is a fork based on the original APG to introduce more features and a new user interface.</p>

<h2>WARNING</h2>
<p>Be careful editing your existing keys, as they WILL be stripped of certificates right now.
<br/><br/>Also: key cross-certification is NOT supported, so signing with those keys will get a warning when the signature is checked.</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>Install K-9 Mail for the best integration, it supports APG for PGP/INLINE and lets you directly encrypt/decrypt emails.
<br/>It is recommended that you install OI File Manager to be able to use the browse button for file selection in APG.
<br/>First you need some keys. Either import them via the option menus in "Manage Keys" and "My Keys" or create them in "My Keys".<p>

<h2>I found a bug in APG!</h2>
<p>Please report it in the <a href="https://github.com/dschuermann/apg/issues">issue tracker of APG</a>.</p>
