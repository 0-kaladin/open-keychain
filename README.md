# APG+

This is a fork of Android Privacy Guard (APG) named APG+

I will try to reintegrate the various forks and build a new stable version, which can be released to the market.

# Build APG+

# Build XZing Integration Library

1. Checkout their SVN (see http://code.google.com/p/zxing/source/checkout)
2. Change android-home variable in "build.properties" in the main directory to point to your Android SDK
3. Change directory to android-integration
4. Build using "ant build"
5. We use "android-integration-supportv4.jar"

On error see: http://code.google.com/p/zxing/issues/detail?id=1207

# Build SpongyCastle
